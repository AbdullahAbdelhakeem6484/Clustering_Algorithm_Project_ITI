DBSCAN vs Merging Mean-Shift with K-Means  (Mean shift and K-Means algorithm are two similar clustering algorithms; both of them extract information from data with some kind of mean vector operations.  compare these two algorithms and show a way, with VisuMap software, to combine them to get much better clustering tools.)
